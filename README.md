ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
Job Tracker is an practical project designed to introduce the fundamentals of the Python programming language in a hands-on way. The application allows users to keep track of their job applications â€” including adding, editing, deleting, and viewing entries â€” all stored in a structured CSV format using the pandas library.

This project serves two key purposes:

ðŸŽ“ To help me become familiar with Python's syntax, standard library, and tools such as virtual environments, version control (Git), and CLI interaction.

ðŸ’¼ To build something practical that I can use during my own job search, while demonstrating my ability to create a clean, useful, and maintainable Python project.

The features are intentionally simple but useful, allowing for future expansion â€” such as filtering/search, data analytics, and possibly even resume/job description analysis.
